# Multi Agent System for Autonomous Public Transport in Amsterdam

A variety of Multi Agent System (MAS) concepts underlies the presented system of public transport in the city of Amsterdam. The system has been implemented using the NetLogo platform as a simulation environment where buses (agents) travel the city picking up and dropping off passengers at different bus stops. Buses are benevolent practical reasoning agents that interact with each other through message exchange, and that work towards a common goal: namely transporting as many passengers as possible in as little time as possible. They form coalitions and make group decisions, but also compete with each other by means of negotiation procedures. 

Final project for the UvA/VU course Multi Agent Systems (Spring 2017). See [report](report/report.pdf).
